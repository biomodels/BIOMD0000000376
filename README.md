**Abstract:**   
Insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells is oscillatory, with a typical
period of 2-7 min, reflecting oscillations in membrane potential and the
cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Our central hypothesis is that the slow 2-7
min oscillations are due to glycolytic oscillations, whereas faster
oscillations that are superimposed are due to Ca(2+) feedback onto metabolism
or ion channels. We extend a previous mathematical model based on this
hypothesis to include a more detailed description of mitochondrial metabolism.
We demonstrate that this model can account for typical oscillatory patterns of
membrane potential and Ca(2+) concentration in islets. It also accounts for
temporal data on oxygen consumption in islets. A recent challenge to the
notion that glycolytic oscillations drive slow Ca(2+) oscillations in islets
are data showing that oscillations in Ca(2+), mitochondrial oxygen
consumption, and NAD(P)H levels are all terminated by membrane
hyperpolarization. We demonstrate that these data are in fact compatible with
a model in which glycolytic oscillations are the key player in rhythmic islet
activity. Finally, we use the model to address the recent finding that the
activity of islets from some mice is uniformly fast, whereas that from islets
of other mice is slow. We propose a mechanism for this dichotomy.
